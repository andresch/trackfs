# FUSE requires that the user that mounts the FUSE filesystem
# has an entry in /etc/passwd
# Since we want to allow (and encourage) the usage of docker's
# --user option to run the container as non-root user, 
# and with that don't know the uid of the user at build time
# we can't create the entry for that user at build time
# and also can't use adduser command during runtime as this would
# require root privileges.
# Instead we open /etc/passwd for writing. 
# As /ets/shadow is still protected this should not cause harm,
# even if some attacker finds a way to take over the container
